# 👋 Hello, I am Ketshia NGALULA AZIZA  

**Energy Engineer | Researcher | Computational Modelling Enthusiast**  

## 🔍 About Me

I am an Energy Engineer with experience in **computational modelling**, **numerical simulation**, and the **analytical design of energy systems**.  
My work combines **engineering analysis** with an understanding of **energy access, policy frameworks, and equitable energy transitions**, especially in African contexts.

My research interests center on:

- Integrated and decentralized energy systems  
- Multi-energy system modelling and system optimization  
- Low-emission combustion technologies  
- Renewable energy access and clean cooking solutions  
- Energy regulation and just transition frameworks

## 🧪 Projects

### 🔥 **Computational Design and CFD Simulation of a Household Biogas Burner**   
📂 Repository: `Biogas_Cookstove_Design_and_CFDSimulation`

This project integrates:

- MATLAB based analytical burner design  
- Geometric modelling (SolidWorks)  
- Cold flow and combustion simulations in ANSYS Fluent  
- Visualization of temperature fields, reaction zones and velocity profiles  

The repository contains the full workflow, including CAD files, MATLAB scripts, CFD setup notes and result contours.

➡️ This work demonstrates my ability to run **complex energy simulations**, interpret **multi variable interactions**, and translate modelling results into **engineering insights**.
