## 🔍 About Me

I am an Energy Engineer with experience in **computational modelling**, **numerical simulation**, and the **analytical design of energy systems**.  
My work combines **engineering analysis** with an understanding of **energy access, policy frameworks, and equitable energy transitions**, especially in African contexts.

My research interests center on:

- Integrated and decentralized energy systems  
- Multi energy system modelling and system optimization  
- Low emission combustion technologies  
- Renewable energy access and clean cooking solutions  
- Energy regulation and just transition frameworks  

I am currently applying for research opportunities in **energy systems modelling**, with the long term goal of contributing to scientific and academic capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
